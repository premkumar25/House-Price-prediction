# House-Price-prediction
Predicting house prices using machine learning models.

It is a Kaggle competition named House price prediction-Advanced regression techinques

Here I have created a simple model to predict the house prices. 

Recommended for Beginners.

House_price.ipynb is the main model
House_price_test.ipynb is the model used for feature engineering for test dataset

Datasets used:
  <ul>test.csv - test dataset</ul> 
  <ul>train.csv - training dataset</ul>
  <ul>test_df.csv - test dataset after exploratory data analysis</ul>


Model is created using Google colab.
